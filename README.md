# Supercomputing_Spin_Up

Getting started on a High Performance Computing cluster, such as Alpine, can be a daunting task for the uninitiated. Join us for this two-part RC Short Course* where we will cover the basics!

Part 1 of this series will discuss the fundamentals of Linux and bash scripting. Topics will include: Linux commands, navigation of a Linux file-system, the Linux environment, creation of bash scripts, and more! You can expect to leave this training with a solid understanding of basic Linux principles and commands.

In order to follow along with the hands-on component of this workshop, youâ€™ll want to have a research computing account. If you need assistance with this, you can attend the RC Quick Byte - Getting a Research Computing Account on April 2,or attend CRDDS Office Hours. Additionally, we will hold Office Hours immediately following this training for any follow-up questions.

* What is an RC Short Course?: An RC Short Course is a training that provides an in-depth understanding of a concept, system, or tool. You can expect to leave a "Short Course" with a solid grasp of the topic.
